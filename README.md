# cfw-bindings-wrangler-bridge

This bridge makes it possible to interact with **remote** Cloudflare Workers bindings(like KV, D1, etc...) from anywhere, even in **local** development.

In a nutshell, you can use actual KV, D1 APIs and data during `vite dev`! üòâ

## ‚úã Before proceeding

If your purpose is to mock bindings only for local development and no initial data is needed or can be easily prepared, this library may not be needed.

In this case, we recommend using [`cloudflare/miniflare@3`](https://github.com/cloudflare/miniflare) as API(`getBindings()` + `dispose()`). It is the official, most reliable implementation and well supported.

If `miniflare` does not match for your case or you really need the remote data, please go ahead. ü§§

## Usage

0Ô∏è‚É£ Install it as usual.

```sh
npm install -D cfw-bindings-wrangler-bridge
```

1Ô∏è‚É£ Set up your `wrangler.toml` properly and start `wrangler dev` process in advance.

```sh
wrangler dev ./node_modules/cfw-bindings-wrangler-bridge/worker.js --remote
```

Of course you can interact with local environment by omitting `--remote`. All the other options(like `--persist-to`) are also available.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create bridge and use it anywhere in your code.

```js
import { createBridge } from "cfw-bindings-wrangler-bridge";

// Default origin is `http://127.0.0.1:8787`
const bridge = createBridge();
// Or specify default origin
// const bridge = createBridge("http://localhost:3000");

/** @type {import("@cloduflare/workers-types").KVNamespace} */
const MY_KV = bridge.KVNamespace("MY_KV");
// For TypeScript
// const MY_KV = bridge.KVNamespace<KVNamespace>("MY_KV");

// ‚úåÔ∏è This is remote KV!
await MY_KV.put("foo", "bar");
await MY_KV.get("foo"); // "bar"
```

Type definitions should be handled by yourself.

More to come...?

### Supported `wrangler` version

v3.13.x

## How it works

This bridge has 2 components.

- Module: Mock module to be `import`ed into your application
  - written as pure ESM
- Worker: Proxy worker to be called by the bridge module
  - hosted by `wrangler dev --remote` in advance

Since bridge module itself is platform agnostic, you can use it on any platform|environment.

- Vite based meta frameworks local development
- CLI tools
- Static Site Generation, Pre-rendering
- Cloudflare Workers in local(`warngler dev`)
- Outside of Cloudflare stack(just deploy `worker.js` for your env and use with `createBridge("https://example.com")`)
- etc...

## Known limitations

### Compatibility issues

The instances and values available from this bridge are not 100% compatible.

For example,

- Binding instances
  - The class constructors like `KVNamespace`, `R2Object`(aka `HeadResult`) are not publicly exposed
- Enumerable instance properties
  - Read-only properties are emulated by simple implementation
  - Some private properties and methods are included
- Exception
  - Not a specific error like `TypeError`, but just an `Error`
- etc...

But I don't think there are any problems in practical use.

### Max limits for API call

For example, KV has a limitation of only being able to call the API up to 1000 operations per 1 worker invocation.

However, via this bridge, the API call becomes a separate worker invocation, which circumvents that limitation.

This may be a problem after you deployed that worker.

### Service bindings

Current `wrangler` implementation does not allow us to mix `wrangler dev (--local)` services and `wrangler dev --remote` services.

> See also https://github.com/cloudflare/workers-sdk/issues/1182

But with this bridge, you can get over it.

```js
// Normal mode
// const MY_SERVICE = bridge.Fetcher("MY_SERVICE");

// Direct mode
const MY_SERVICE = bridge.Fetcher("", "http://127.0.0.1:8686");
```

With direct mode, you can mix `wrangler dev --remote` and `wrangler dev (--local)`.
At this time, however, the value of `request.origin` will be different from the actual environment.

### Vectorize bindings

Since `wrangler(miniflare)` does not support Vectorize yet, you need `--remote` to interact with Vectorize binding.

## Examples

### CLI

<details>

If you are using REST API in your CLI, now you can replace it.

```diff
-const putKV = async (API_KEY, API_URL, [key, value]) => {
-  const res = await fetch(`${API_URL}/values/${key}`, {
-    method: "PUT",
-    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${API_KEY}` },
-    body: value,
-  });
-
-  const json = await res.json();
-  if (!json.success)
-    throw new Error(json.errors.map(({ message }) => message).join("\n"));
-};
+import { createBridge } from "cfw-bindings-wrangler-bridge";
+
+const putKV = async (KV_BINDING_NAME, [key, value]) => {
+  const KV = createBridge().KVNamespace(KV_BINDING_NAME);
+  await KV.put(key, value);
+};
```

</details>

### SvelteKit local development

<details>

Be sure to wrap with `if (dev) {}`, not to be included in production build.

```js
// server.hooks.js
import { createBridge } from "cfw-bindings-wrangler-bridge";
import { dev } from "$app/environment";

export const handle = async ({ event, resolve }) => {
  if (dev) {
    const bridge = createBridge();

    event.platform = {
      env: {
        SESSIONS: bridge.KVNamespace("SESSIONS"),
        TODOS: bridge.D1Database("TODOS"),
      },
    };
  }

  return resolve(event);
};
```

</details>

### Astro local development

<details>

Be sure to wrap with `if (import.meta.env.DEV) {}`, not to be included in production build.

```astro
---
// your-page.astro
import { getRuntime } from "@astrojs/cloudflare/runtime";
import { createBridge } from "cfw-bindings-wrangler-bridge";

let runtime = getRuntime(Astro.request) ?? {};
if (import.meta.env.DEV) {
  const bridge = createBridge();

  runtime.env = {
    NEWS: bridge.KVNamespace("NEWS"),
  };
}
---

<!-- ... -->
```

</details>

## Implementation notes

- Why not use REST API?
  - REST API cannot offer `--local` behavior
  - Not all bindings, features are supported
- How about using `wrangler` CLI commands?
  - Features are limited too, no KV metadata support, etc...
- `wrangler.unstable_dev()` is better?
  - Maybe? but it is literally unstable
  - `await worker.stop()` should be called properly, but how?
    - Performance may suffer if repeating start/stop on every call?
  - I don't want to care which version of `wrangler` to be used, supported
    - Someone may use a fixed version of `wrangler` for some reason
  - Path to `wrangler.toml` should be managed
